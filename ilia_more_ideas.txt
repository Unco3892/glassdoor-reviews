Text mining project ideas

TAKE the reviews with at least 3-4 words using the tokens_subset(ntoken()) from the active learning part of the excercises.

Use the same topics as the 5 categories that were given originally on glassdoor or fit 3-4 topics.

Fit an LDA model in your project

A grpah similar to the LDA on slide 19 where you would have pros and cons per text on the y_axis, and then the 4 main topics on the top x-axis. Do this similar to the last plot of 1.2 excercises from topic modelling, you can actually do it in the exact same way.

Try a word-embedding and then for the final model you can use pre-trained GloVe. He would really like us to use this in the project.

Supplementary features --> What will you use in your project work?

Files and apis are not important. Regarding the encoding, we don't need to know the theory however we should know some of the elements we covered, why they are important and especially their consequence, for instance why their characters are not decoded correctly. He will not ask how we'll do the encoding. Calculations for this part are not and we just need to know the consequences of such things (moving from OS to another) and somehow what could be the strategy to solve this.

Scrape glassdoor again for the three recommend, negative and doesn't recommand.

See this for the word embedding: https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2017-12-22-word-embeddings-with-keras/


Penalized logisitc regression is like a NN with one hidden layer, you can use L1 with NN to take this into account.

Str_contain for the hashtags!


Three classification tasks can be done:
1. Company
2. Positive vs Negative reviews
3. Employer_rating given (from 1-5)

You can also take the log of the length of the review as a feature

For modelling do something like the active learning chapter and do a NN with the features such as curret and former, LSA/LDA and possibility RNN or a pre-trained model based on Romain's experience.
