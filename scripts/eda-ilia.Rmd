```

## Definitions

`Corpus` = All reviews on GlassDoor for five major banks
`Text` = Reviews for each bank --> Used this also as the `Document`
`Tokens` = Words in each review

### Data structure

```{r}
bank_reviews %>% glimpse
```

The dataset consists of `r length(unique(bank_reviews$company))` banks which are `r unique(bank_reviews$company) %>% paste(.,collapse = ", ")`.

We can summarize the information for each bank.

NOTE TO ilia: Replace the function below with an across as summarize_if is deprecated.

```{r}
# General overview
bank_reviews %>%
  select(company, employer_rating:senior_management) %>%
  group_by(company) %>%
  add_count() %>%
  summarize_if(is.numeric,
               c(
                 "mean" = function(x)
                   mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
                 "median" = function(x)
                   median(x, na.rm = TRUE)
               )) %>%
  relocate(company, n_median) %>%
  rename("number of reviews" = n_median) %>%
  kable_maker()

# An alternative shorter approach
bank_reviews %>% 
  dplyr::count(company, name = "number of reviews") %>% 
  kable_maker()
```

## EDA
A general EDA for the reviews Note that here we treat each company as a document.

```{r}
# creating function to take out the pros and cons of the reviews

            text_column,

# TF approach

cons_tf <- EDA_handler(bank_reviews, employer_cons)


# TF_IDF approach
pros_tf_idf <- EDA_handler(bank_reviews, employer_pros, n_top = 1,TF_grouped= TRUE, TF_IDF = TRUE)
cons_tf_idf <- EDA_handler(bank_reviews, employer_cons, n_top = 1,TF_grouped= TRUE, TF_IDF = TRUE)

# The grouped and specific to each document --> Only one word is shown which is quite strange and requires more investigation
pros_grouped <- EDA_handler(bank_reviews, employer_pros, n_top = 1, TF_grouped= TRUE)

# Finally, for the wordcloud, firstly it takes a while to render and then, there are two problems with it, a) it does not generate the word management for cons and b, if outputs as `null` all the time, for that to be resolved, ggwordcloud library could be used as explained by the code below.
pros_cloudy <- EDA_handler(bank_reviews, employer_pros, n_top = 1, word_cloud = TRUE)

# aggregated wordcloud can also be produced.

# The code that can be used as a wordcloud replacement is the following.
  #   if (word_cloud == TRUE) {
  #     top_words <- freq %>% top_n(100, wt= n)
  #     cloudy_words <-
  #       ggplot(top_words, aes(label = get(new_col), size =n)) +
  # geom_text_wordcloud(area_corr = TRUE, rm_outside = TRUE)+
  #     # eccentricity = 0.35
  # scale_size_area(max_size = 50) +
  #   theme_minimal()
  #     }
  #   cloudy_words
  # }

# what more to be done?
# lexical diversity
# compute keynesses
```

The ggplot represents the most frequent words per company as the grouping was not done on the review but the company itself.

Regarding the pros, most often the words `benefit` and `people` come up, it is also interesting to see that the words `culture`, and `life` are also there perhaps indicating that most people care about these values when trying to describe work positively.

We can see that the most cons were associated with the word `management`. This is followed by `employees`, `hour` and `time`. Furthermore we have the same `people` word in the cons meaning that we would have to put our analysis into contenxt and use the valence shifters to see if they mention something good about people or bad about these people.

See wordcloud 2 with the tm package from here https://towardsdatascience.com/create-a-word-cloud-with-r-bde3e7422e8a
library(wordcloud2)

<!-- See on average how many words each review contains -->

Also `quanteda` library could be used if needed..

```{r}
dummy <- bank_reviews$employer_pros %>% corpus()
