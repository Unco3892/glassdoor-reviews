And by system breaks, I mean variances between subsystems and the ledger that you can’t figure out because it’s next to impossible to research. I’m not entirely sure how this place passes audit to be honest. It’s a very unstable job because they’re always trying to cut costs and headcount. There were numerous times in my time there where entire teams were done away with or the roles were offshored to India. In fact, since I’ve left I’ve heard the Business Finance function as a whole is migrating to India. And then they expect you to go over there for months to train the people taking your job. Turnover is extremely high, with entire teams including managers turning over within a year or 2. Many people left to go to the other investment bank downtown. If you decide to leave, it’s likely you will get the cold shoulder (and sometimes open hostility) from your manager and directors the rest of your time there. If you try to move to another team, your current manager will often block you moving no matter how unhappy you are so you can’t take another role. I saw people I worked with quit without a job lined up yet because they couldn’t take it anymore.  Promotions are hard to get because of how political the process is and how much it relies on you having significant interaction with NY. To top it all off, management will read feedback like this and then honestly question why employee morale is so low and why the environment is so negative. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone and I wouldn’t go back for double my salary.",1,3,1,1,4,1,NA,NA

The people are great; during my three year tenure I forged lifelong friendships with people I'll be in touch with for the rest of my life. Vacation days for those at the analyst/associate level can go up to 28 days for the full year, include rollover days, which is awesome! Fairly lax management who allows you to take the reigns without too much micromanagement. This obviously depends on the team, but I was on three different teams in three years and found that I was able to have free reign without too much pushback under the management I had to deal with.

Being able to have full access to the cafeteria in the basement as well as good La Colombe coffee across the street is also a nice perk. Everything you need is essentially within an arm's reach in FiDi.","Cons: pay is WELL below market value across front, back and middle office functions. People are generally jaded due to low P&L generation as well as less deal flow due to DB's recent reputation on the Street. Because of the aforementioned factors, DB is losing out on young talent rapidly because they are unable to compete with comparable offers other investment banks are giving to those who have decided to jump ship. Moreover, recruiters are actively reaching out to and poaching Deutsche employees due to the current state of the place. It's sad because in its hey-day, DB was probably one of the top European investment banks to work for and now everyone talks about it as though its a modern day Titanic. 

Senior managers are also being pushed out due to being too expensive. Even those higher-ups who do generate P&L have been let go because Deutsche simply cannot afford to keep them on payroll. Cost-cutting is the name of the game and it has sadly made for a very angry and frustrating work environment.

Lastly, Deutsche's infrastructure is so broken and bureaucratic it makes it virtually impossible for front office to generate new business. If a counterparty wants to set up a subaccount to trade a certain product with DB, the process takes weeks when it should only take 10 minutes. If an entirely new client wants to trade with us, forget it... that process can take months. Sometimes, by the time an account gets up and running to trade, the client is so disenchanted with our disorganized onboarding process that they decide the hassle isn't worth it.

Overall, I gained a lot of knowledge during my three years at DB. It was honestly an awesome place to start a career and build a decent nest egg, but if you're looking for A-grade comp at an uber competitive investment bank, look elsewhere as DB will only provide you with enough to get by and the place itself isn't terribly competitive because they can't afford to be.",3,5,4,1,3,2,NA,NA

With the recent senior management changes at board level, there are some glimmers of sense as the much needed rationalisation has happened in abundance - hopefully the target will soon be on the local Cary Director ""leadership"" as there is plenty of dead wood to strip there.

The working area is ok.  Somewhat like a call center instead of a development environment, which is kinda ok as not a huge amount of real development happens here.  Elbow room is in short supply, but this is compensated by the comedy of the center wide town halls which are a real hoot!
Deutsche Bank benefits are great.  Free holiday, pension, health-care and the work-life-balance of what is essentially an easy life make this an opportunity that is hard to overlook for anyone.  Second jobbing is entirely possible.
Bonuses went the way of the dodo a few years back and this resulted in a brain drain that made us a popular invite for any quiz-based social.  Gallows humor is common-place, which is a real positive, especially with the yearly cycle of musical chairs where we are often dumb-founded by the same near-misses year after year.
In the absence of old-style banking compensation, the balance of few promotions has swung to ""promote anyone"" this is good for the long-termers as there must be some corrections to be made, however it's a ""Con"" too (I'll describe below).","The nuggets of good I referred to as a positive are sadly not evident in Cary.  There are nuggets, just a different type, and this would nicely describe the local directorship.  The ego amongst the non-contributor population is often breathtaking.  Lots of references to ""my guys"", but little loyalty come compensation distribution and standing up to their higher achieving counterparts in the Financial Centers.
In reference to the ""promote anyone"" mentality, the quality requirement bar has dropped significantly.    Being a senior leader at Deutsche Bank use to really mean something with the MDs and Directors being some of the best in the game, now I would suggest they are operating at a minus one, as-in, MDs are the old Directors, Directors -> VPs and so-on.

I have been in the Jacksonville office for 4 years and have seen countless scenarios of amazing performers being turned down for the ONCE A YEAR promotion process (no you cannot be promoted outside of this annual process) to Associate/AVP etc due to politics and department caps, yet absolute garbage employees being hired for Associate/AVP externally. Your entire job here is soul sucking because you spend all day every day fixing ""breaks"" between systems that the company is too cheap to properly implement. There is no IT here, only clerks in India with a poorly written manual and a manager demanding they close out the work ticket. Constant reorgs trying to figure out how to fix the myriad of issues yet they only serve to give certain people promotions while the others suffer and are left confused as to who they report to. At the end of the day you just have MORE bosses. Toxic work environment where the managers won't even talk to you or acknowledge your existence unless you quit, then they get upset because once again they have to go through the painful round of hiring a candidate which due to company bureaucracy takes between 3-4 months. If you are applying here don't give notice until just before your start date or you could go without a paycheck for months. A lot of people just quit the department to go to a competitor in town BEFORE bonuses were even paid out, that speaks for the desperation to leave and the sub par quality of bonuses. There is zero recognition for hard/above and beyond work because either your manager will take credit or simply no one cares. Once again only those favorites will get a promotion. Complete mismatch between companies stated values and actual quality of work. The department also makes the foolish mistake of only having one person trained on a unique role so that if you decide to move internally you will be stuck training your replacement for months on end, or if you quit they beg you to train your external replacement, who won't start for months.....Maybe other departments are okay to work for but certainly not product control or whatever they decided to name themselves today. If you are a manager elsewhere looking to hire a DB employee don't look down on the fact that someone here hasn't been promoted, chances are they deserved to be many times over, DB just doesn't promote promotions.... You can't even begin to explain how poor the work environment is here, you just have to witness it. Or maybe ask around.....",1,1,1,1,4,1,NA,NA

Despite being a high performer, there is no scope for growth. DB (especially Cary location) is a big NO NO for people with talent. In fact, they are the most unsuited species for its culture. Most of the power controls are in London and NY and they have vested interests in not letting Cary grow. Someone with good potential is targeted, mistreated, given worthless work and eventually forced to quit by exercising their political might. Most of the management (Directors & VPs) are undeserving loyalist who are only rubber stamps, taking orders from their bosses in NY or London and in return they survive the job (and even get promoted). This is helped by the HB2 hiring freeze and the bank's cost cutting measures which limited the growth in Cary. The technical architects (most of them controlling from London & NY) are highly incapable to even designing basic systems but are given a free hand because of their proximity to those who matter at the cost of quality. You can even find vendors architects & managers dominating and mistreating FTEs only because of support they hold from the powerful. Most of the applications in the bank are outdated and badly designed to handle today's needs. The HR and the senior management is well aware of this but has done nothing except for mentioning it in a couple of town halls & interact sessions. On the contrary, starting last year, even the authority of deciding the recognition award & promotion candidates in Cary was given to London & NY panels. This was a final nail in the coffin for Cary's sovereignty to retain good talent and do what is good for them.
To conclude, the overall atmosphere in the bank is highly political and counterproductive where talented new joiners will only add to a mass of frustrated zombies found everywhere throughout the centre now-a-days.",1,2,1,1,3,1,NA,NA

Come here to be bored.,Current Employee - Software Development Engineer,I have been working at Deutsche Bank full-time for more than 3 years,"There's a free fitness center.  There's a cafe.  You get lots of vacation.  In some teams, you can do absolutely nothing, work 5 hours a day and go home.   If you are a mediocre developer, if you can get onto a team on the second floor, you might have a long career there.  Bonuses used to be good.  Salaries are good.  Insurance is good.  If you can put up with it working here, you'll have a good chance to be poached by a different company.","The office in Cary is filled with incompetent senior managers.  The least competent is at the top, followed by the management team.  Why?  Because they're cast-offs, or imports from elsewhere.  The ones in banking don't understand software development, and the ones in software are the people fired from middle management of other companies.  

This is honestly a dead-end if you want a career.  They talk about ""expert path"" for technical people which doesn't exist, at least not in Cary.  You will have no autonomy as all the decisions are made in London and NY.  Your senior manager is put in place by those same teams nervous about hiring outside of the hubs, so his job is just to work you until you quit and not to make any noise such as picking good software or practices.  Your failure provides them cover to not transfer jobs from their location.  They have never promoted anyone in Cary to a senior position- the last three directors weren't even from other Deutsche Bank locations; they went outside the company instead of promote one of the more than 100 existing managers or senior developers.  There is a serious flight of talent- other companies are easily able to poach people who are competent, able to work under pressure, and worth every penny of their salary.  Speaking of which, you used to get a bonus for all the downsides mentioned above.  No more.   It depends on the performance of the company  to get a maximum of 4%.  Take a look at the stock and you'll see how unlikely that is.    Diversity is overdone- protected groups can't be fired, and no one cares to take the time to hire good talent, they just want to have bodies to fill their hiring quotas.  The center head stood up in front of the employees at a town hall and said he's going to hire 50% women. What happened to equal opportunity hiring?   Oh and the fitness center and cafe mentioned as ""pro"" are just 'meh', but I had to say something nice to fill in that box.  Which is what you'll do for several hours a week- mandatory training classes for financial stuff which you'll never use as a developer but bureaucracy rules.  The HR team is horrible- they live in a little private area, through a card-key door, so you can't interact with them.  If you ask them a question, they'll reply with ""call the hotline'.  Everyone desk is a 'trading desk', meaning they've crammed people into huge open areas with the same double-monitor and phone on the side of the desks with employees 5-wide and back to back.  Even call centers have more room.  They've got 800+ people in one building that other residents of the office park have closer to 300 in theirs.  If you need time to concentrate on working out a difficult debugging or clever software solution: give up.  The noise level doesn't allow it (*See working late or weekends comment).

You spend an obscene amount of your day obtaining approvals to deliver your code from people you will never meet. You are surrounded by people who afraid to speak up because they are on Visas. 

It is apparent that kissing up to superiors is common. If you actually accomplish something good, your managers acts as if it's no big whoop; if you are slightly late, they are all over you. They think that pointing out faults is ""mentoring and coaching"". You see managers telling their employees exactly how to do something, even though they are professionals who can figure it out.

On some teams, work from home is discouraged so there's less flexibility than at other places. There are no offices or cubicles, though the workspace is nice and resembles that of a startup.

Great benefits. Health, dental, and vision plans are excellent. For a company in the US, there are lots of vacation days (over 4 weeks). 

Very good networking opportunities. There is a wealth of groups which do all kinds of fun activities. Groups meet regularly and it's an excellent way to get to know coworkers and make office connections.

The location. The Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina is a great area to live in.","Frustrating experience dealing with work computers and tech programs/tools. The computers are really locked down and it's often difficult to find the right tools for the job that aren't years out of date (I've seen this process improving, but slowly). There is little flexibility in choosing your tools for any particular technical task (it's not an option to install what you like). GitHub is blocked for most people.

Abundance of middle management. I've been on a team consisting of half managers and half workers. Certainly not every team is like this, and it's probably a result of being a large place.

There is a severe lack of technical knowledge among large amounts of employees (working in a software development environment). Many people aren't skilled enough to do their jobs well. One example: a manager on my team doesn't trust automated regression testing (they are not technically knowledgable about the development process) so even though we have a fully automated regression testing suite, people are required to *manually* test everything in releases before managers will approve the release, soaking up large amounts of time and resources. Knowledge of the basics should be expected, as it's a software development center. As a developer, is can be extremely frustrating to deal with so many people who don't know a thing about coding or development or computers at all, but are still supposed to work in a technical job.

Recognition and compensation is often largely tied to who you know, and less about how much of a difference you make. Of course, many people received what they deserved or even more, but for every person I know has been compensated/promoted fairly, I know another who was not at all compensated what they should have been.

Everybody is president , vice presidents and managers.. too less people who really work.. so of course work pressure... That's what managers are for right? Make tech slave labor work. or how else managers will get big bonuses?

Their new policy is to lure tech guys from other countries or other states to leave their good jobs dreaming big bonuses and peaceful life , come to this remote location of Cary...then make them work like slaves. Hire one senior tech guy and then hire four beginners so that this experienced guy will actually teach the beginners everything and even DO their job... as they are ""no-vice"".. so make sure you are not that ""experienced guy""

This is not a bank. It's a bank's IT development center. So basically we develop applications for bank. So it works like a IT shop with all the crap that comes with it....

Every body ready to cut your throat to get anybody out of his bonus way. Everybody looks like in pressure and panic state.
If you are looking for great work atmosphere and peaceful life where you can work and do some innovative work then DON'T come to this Cary Development Center.

Low quality hiring low quality in abundance.
Center management woefully out of the depth and seem to be clueless about what we do.
Computers and kit last decade.  
Desktop support is laughably bad - usually resort to getting under the desk to fix ourselves.
""Agile"" means something very different here: Lots of standing around whiteboards with posties.  Ceremony over intended purpose.
Town halls are a drag.  No relevance and must serve only the ego of the center management who's apparent understanding of technology is utterly tangental to anyone developing software this century.  Lots of side-way glances as we sigh WTF in unison.
Project delivery is shambolic.  Wins are rare as failure is accepted with a shrug.
Long-termers stay as they are payed above market rate.
Traditional relationship between low cost offshore and rich masters.  Unfortunately we are the former so are regarded as a call center in a third world country.
Lots of jolly nice people who should not be working in a technology office, but have created niches as ""transition project managers""
Lots of gossip about the next (then the next) round of redundancies.  Apparently lots of people have more lives than cats.
Promotion seems to be linked to age.
% of staff are fired every year.  Candidates are selected through comical darwinism.  Secret meetings are called, their desks are cleared whilst they are in the ""meeting"", asta la vista.  Then another meeting is called by management to say firings have stopped, consider yourself lucky and get back to work fast.  They try to make this seem compassionate, but everyone is just pleased the wheel of (mis) fortune didn't stop with them.

Management is absolutely horrible and they do not know the process flows or their employees roles and tasks. Reminds me of a sweat shop, they work you till the point of feeling sick. Minimum 60 hour weeks. Jacksonville location likes to bring VP's in from London and eliminate advancement. They come over here and all they care about is production at your expense.  They don't care that you have a life or a family.  

AVPs are under qualified and can not help or do anything. In transaction accounting if you ask the management something be ready to get a political I have no idea answer or a wrong answer that you will pay for dearly later. 

Managers like to whisper and gossip about employees and even mock and talk badly about them in front of team members. And if someone quits then they trash talk that person continuously. They blame you for leaving and say it's your fault but yet 80% turn over rate in 12 months tells you there is a problem. Human resources is completely useless they know the issues and do nothing. 

I could go a week and AVPs and VP's that you sit within 10 feet up and they don't acknowledge you or speak to you unless they need or want something. 

Be prepared to do 3-4 person workloads even workloads of higher ranks and not be compensated.

This place is toxic and they do not care if you quit they trash you and replace you with someone less qualified.

This was the worst position I've ever had in my life!! It gets me worked up just thinking about it again.   For starters let's recap the whole experience. When I began I spent about 2 weeks on the phone with tech support trying to get my computer working with all the necessary programs with no help from managers or colleagues. 

I was given the work of 3 people and when I spoke to management about reducing the load due to stress I was told to manage my time better. This comment sent me through the roof. Others on my team always got their one hour lunch and left right at 5. However, I was there many nights after 8p.m. with none of my colleagues around. When determining who should do what on the team someone made a comment about my salary that I was making ""Big Bucks"" and more senior people than me were overlooked in being assigned certain tasks.

The salary wasn't much higher than my previous employer and I was actually making more money at my previous employer, but thought this would be a better opportunity but I was completely wrong.

The organization as a whole is too top heavy. Constant emails from different ExCos about people we have no interaction with changing job roles and taking over responsibilities that aren't even obliquely related. This happens almost monthly, to no real benefit.

Constant re-orgs allow incompetent employees to hide and maintain their status. Little to no accountability for teams that manage vendors - the vendors always fail to deliver, and the teams managing them get away with it because of the constant re-orgs.

Tech projects are almost always top heavy. Too many people with no idea about what it takes to build a product involved in the process giving invalid opinions, trying to be the smartest person in the room. Too many meetings, too much design by committee. Projects run over budget and under deliver as a result. Business partners aren't held accountable for the failure and move on to new projects to continue the cycle of ruination.

Obstructionism by teams in other locations doing similar work is common. Land grabs for projects and people occur constantly with the re-orgs, allowing empires to be built. Middle management seems to solely be concerned with owning projects instead of delivering value.",3,5,3,3,4,2,NA,NA

In the past year almost the entire leadership team has either been fired or departed and what is left is almost constant haggling amongst middle management to own teams and step into dead mens shoes, regardless of being qualified.

The bank has chosen a SAS import who is completely uninterested in what we are doing and creates authority through fear leaving most quaking and the rest kissing it.  Most of us are unclear how this guy does as we take all of our direction from the London domain leads.  I'm sure he is as nervous about his own position as we are so he is kissing his respected asses and not delivering utility down to us.  Then we have a hired a Chief Development Officer - what Development is this role responsible for and where is the proven calibre?

Our recent town hall said it all: we want to ""reverse the pyramid"" which means our management are fixated in adhering to organizational shape over finding the right people then incentivizing the good people to stay.  

This week a further 15 heads were culled, which followed similar exercises over the past 5 months leaving many scared about their future.  Why not take a look at why these people didn't achieve success and question whether the organization provides an environment where success is achievable without politics and back-stabbing??

I do not believe Deutsche Bank understands the locality or the technology profession.  Let's say it possibly did at one time, now this is in full reverse.  We started with a message of work/life balance, a table tennis table and a relaxed dress code and now the latter being recently stripped so we look nice for our new New York matrix managers who have no clue about what makes technology people tick.  North Carolina is not about double-breasted suits, politics and ""greed is good"" - if we wanted this we would get paid a lot more to live in New York.

If you like constant change, then this is the place for you.  Frequent reshuffles and changes in leadership happen, so you could see this as an opportunity if you can stick it out.   Deutsche Bank is undergoing a large scale refactoring akin to the Final Solution, jobs are being created in low-cost centers like Cary, so this creates opportunity.  Promotion is possible - Keep your eyes open and turn up then you will get promoted and receive a fat bonus

It is undergoing some changes to the building, the environment is spacious with lots of walls to put post-it notes on.  There is now more meeting rooms than people - which is good.

The CTC, as it is now known, underwent significant growth in 2013, then is retracting again in 2014 with a hire-freeze and mass firing.  As the other reviewer mention its is a flailing investment bank and it has recently woke up and realized it has too many people and it is not making enough money to keep them.  Don't worry though, if you can code it will be a long way to get to you.

Little communication from senior managers outside of the beginning and end of year.

Forced ranking.

The hiring process is bad... and you wondered why you stuck it out.  The recruitment team were often to blame but the HR team must accept the majority.  Escalate and make enough noise, then HR wakes up - but why then?  Most of us need jobs for our families.  Make sure you are financially stable and able to take the time out to be on boarded otherwise you will find it V. STRESSFUL.

The technology stack is so far out of date - yet we are wedded to it because somebody, somewhere decided it was the right thing.  It is too 2005 and this is 2014.  Wake up!!! Suggesting anything else is pointless as our managers do not own the decisions or are scared to challenge anything.  

I stupidly moved from a real technology company where we had a purpose and the environment was pleasant.  I moved for the change in money and the oversold prospects..  I regretted every day since to the point I found another job.

Decent PTO and holidays. Management generally let's you work flex time - I am not a morning person and generally didn't get to work before 9am. My manager never gave me a hard time about it as long as I got 40 hours in. Bonus was about 10% of my base as long as quality was good. Also I felt that quality control was generally pretty fair in their reviews, although others disagree with me on that. Overall I was appreciative to have this job.","Not able to get your DE unless you worked in a particular physical office in 2 states only; lots of regulation impact on employees - such as, not allowed to use excel (seriously, and if you were caught using excel worksheets you were in trouble), random mid-year in-person interviews by internal auditors; training was rough - not enough access to help when needed and the corporate trainor didn't even know how to use the lending software - sent us back totally unprepared ; they use a program called ""core"" for underwriting and it is glitchy (for example, when the last condition is cleared the loan will automatically CTC itself. So let's say you cleared all uw conditions, but the title and appraisal were not in file yet. Those come in later and get cleared by the collateral review team. Without any warning, your loan issues it's own clear to close status. This causes you to miss anything new added to the loan before the loan gets audited by QC. Also, once a loan is in CTC status it can never be moved back. So if the loan suddenly isn't ctc anymore (let's say documents expired), it will stay in CTC status, making it hard to manage your pipeline/be aware of the true status of a loan.  Also- the system ""recommends"" a document to be attached to a condition and people overseas will attach conditions at 2am. (Processors don't really process here, they just resubmit loans when they see that the system recommended a document to a condition). No control at all over what processors do. Underwriter essentially becomes the processor much of the time. Finally, exceptions to credit policy were painstaking to request. Long turn time to get a reply and the system would lock you from making any changes, including canceling the request! This was very annoying.",4,5,5,4,5,NA,5,NA

only real reason I stayed","Big company problems. From lower to higher management the entire company is CORRUPT. Work abuse, favoritism, intimidation, bias/racism... you name it

They mask it all very well by providing every employee with bogus corporate training and videos that make you believe you're in a safe work environment but you're not. They try to give you the time to take them all but no one ever does because they'd rather use that time to do other activities that help them either keep their job or keep from getting written up. The way they approach development and issues with your work is patronizing. Every meeting is just a series of questions that lead to another question that eventually lead to an explanation of how you're incompetent as an employee. They didn't say it, you say it, so its an HR friendly of telling you you suck, work harder. When you do get something right they pat you on the back and say nice but how come you didn't do this ALSO. The fear of lower level employees drives the lowkey intimidation all of management know they have. Everyone is SCARED to speak up in fear of retaliation. Then the company falls back on the most bogus no retaliation policy that comes way of those useless trainings and videos I mentioned before. So you speak up on the fact retaliation is still happening despite the policy and then the company hides behind an HR department that's suppose to protect you. HR is an absolute joke. Opened several claims to HR even in groups involving half the team members to no avail. Every answer back from them was a professional and corporate friendly way of saying, ""we understand and empathize with your problem but we don't agree, deal with it."" or ""we understand we're going to talk to upper management"" then upper management sides with the people you have a problem with because they're buddies. 

Ridiculous work expectations and performance that's globally expected due to the intimidation factor and complete lack of confidence and support. You will feel overworked and absolutely dread or fear coming to work 

Don't make any last minute or even 1-2 week plans in advance you have to ask for vacation 4 weeks in advance and still hope it doesn't interfere with anyone else's schedule

Sunday off but 2nd day off is completely random 

Don't even get me started on the WORST commission structure of all time. especially now that they're apologizing for opening fake accounts. And whatever commission you make gets paid 3 months later, what a joke. 

Lastly depending on your location a certain ethnic group will most likely dominate the work place even up to higher management so you'll experience racism/favoritism to some guaranteed degree if you're not part of that group. But remember they'll mask that too and keep it under wraps with those same bogus policies and a PHENOMENAL HR team. Sarcasm implied*",1,2,1,3,2,NA,3,NA

-Benefits are good, and there are many options available.  New team members start with 12 or 13 days of PTO, 2 personal holidays, and 2 community service days in addition to regular bank holidays.
-The top priority managers teach their team is to focus on the customers need through understanding what’s most important to them and not the bank.","-Middle management is a joke and half.  My District Manager stays at home 4/5 days a week and managed by emailing reports. I think I may see them once every other month which is not supportive of my career development. Unfortunately, this a trend from market to market. I’m not sure what happens when someone becomes a DM... someone need to look at that.
-As a Branch Manager, it can be difficult to complete your responsibilities due to staffing issues that never end. It’s hard to be upset, because most of them move to different areas or get promoted. It’s just really hard to get a posting for a new position. 
-Our teller and banker systems are outdated. They have errors and delay customer interactions on a daily basis.
-There is no sales incentive for doing well. More times than not, a branch that has large volumes of customer traffic will always receive higher payout than smaller branches.  The customers literally come to those branches to apply for accounts. They way the incentive is made, branch balance totals are adjusted so frequently that you never understand if your branch is actually growing!  This makes it difficult for a manager to motivate their team to exceed customer expectations each day. I see where they’re coming from.. why work harder when they’re going to pay you incentive for just coming to work LOL.
-The pay structure is silly. Like May companies, they make salary decisions based on how easy or difficult is will be to retain you.  So if I live in an area with less jobs equal to mine at other companies, they have a lower risk of me leaving and pay me less. If I live in an area with a lot of competition for my skills, they pay more. This causes team members to get paid less for the same job someone is doing in another area regardless of their work ethic. Raises? 1% if you perform, 2% if you exceed, 3% if you do some type of sexual favor for your boss if you can find them after they give you keys to the branch. I’m kidding about the 3%. That’s too generous for them. 
-The training has become the worst I’ve ever seen at a company of this size. When I first began in 2012, they taught more in-depth material that allowed you to come into the branch with a basic idea of what you’re doing. Now, my team members come in the branch with two weeks of questions to ask. Unfortunately, the manager has to then choose to do their tasks or support the team member by actually training them. Of course I choose my team members development which leads to extra hours in the Branch for myself after close for everything else. 
-I feel appreciated by upper management, but it’s lip service most of the time. I think they expect my direct manager to do the leg work to make me feel valued and that’s missing completely. After numerous positive customer reviews, the recognition I receive is only based on me teaching other people how to achieve the same business results. Can I at least get a breakfast muffin? Or even an empty bag with an imaginary muffin? Ok, well let’s start with a thank you and go from there  :)
-Geez look at the time - by now you may be thinking I’m a disgruntled employee, but I’m not. I just feel the bank could support areas better than they are and meet the commitments they strive to meet with their team members like they attempt to do with customers.",4,3,5,5,3,2,NA,NA

They are as follows:

1. Management: The people in charge have created such a toxic culture that anyone you would want to work under or with leaves within 1-2 years. Many senior RM staff are simply there because they cannot find another job and will make your life very difficult. Throwing underlings under the bus is a regular occurrence and promotion is based on politics and desperation to get someone to stay that has told management they are leaving. 

2: Career Development: There is none unless you are extremely lucky. Trying to move to different groups will often not be allowed and management can deny your transfer for any reason. After this you will be marked as not “loyal” and you essentially have no future. Few, if any of the things you will do will be transferable to real finance jobs so your time in the position will be viewed by other employers as little better then unemployment. Trying to better yourself through school or programs such as the CFA or CAIA is highly discouraged and can lead to outright retaliation in some cases. 

Pay: You will be paid 25-40% less then the same job at other banks and will be paid 30-50% less then what you would make on the principal side in a finance position. Bonuses are reserved for those that feed managements ego so expect to make only 10-25% of your bonus potential no matter how well you preform.",1,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA

-They strung contractors along for well over two years before they got frustrated and left; they were dedicated and reliable workers, and new contractors were a mixed bag.
-In my last year, we changed over multiple managers; I believe our immediate manager tried to shield us from a lot of things, but upper management pressed hard, which trickled down to the Processors
-Micro-managing. We were only allowed seven minutes the entire day to use the restroom. As the bathrooms were on the other side of the floor, one visit took 3 1/2 minutes, running. 
-Work environment became toxic, and by the time I left, the turnover rate had been rising.
-Managers no longer were transparent; goals changed frequently without warning, and upper management became obviously disdainful of the Processors when we didn't meet 100% SLA (our team worked with appraisers all over the country, and most of the time if a report didn't come in on time, it meant the appraiser had trouble or just didn't bother doing the report).

And of course, if your child is sick and you have to stay home you also are not allowed to work from home and are forced to use a full day of PTO which eats up days off that could have been spent with with the family and/or vacationing. Furthermore, we are not allowed to make up more than 4 hours in a week and I have been told by management that they ""don't have to let me make up any time unless it was missed for a scheduled appointment.""  I'm sorry but life happens, especially for people with multiple children.

They also  tend to cross-train a lot and encourage you to learn as much as possible and take on more responsibility. I had a great experience working there, for the most part. Employees, especially managers, also get paid far more here than at other banks.","Access to information is not only difficult but sometimes info is non-existent, forcing a lot of time and energy toward finding an answer (usually only to have support specialists not not the answer either). Stores also sometimes create their own rules and there's a lot of inconsistency with guidelines put into play. There are waaaaay too many different programs to do simple and frequent tasks. Upper management seem to never know when and how to implement change appropriately; Particularly with technology. Why implement a program during the Summer when there's more customer traffic, people are taking time off and naturally have staffing shortages (and without any preparation for it in advance)?You're setting your teams up for failure. I know of quite a few policy violations that take place on a very consistent basis and there are managers that I have worked with that are guilty of illegal activity, playing favorites and breaking company policy on a regular basis and they still work there, despite having HR involved in some cases. I just don't get it. Some people manage to stay while others get fired for accidental or trivial policy violations. I have seen the brown-nosers get ahead of everyone else that performs well. In a business that is all about building relationships, sometimes top performers get crapped on if they're not kissing enough butt to the right people.  Pay increases are extremely difficult to get beyond 2% if you stay in the same store, even if you kick the crap out of your goals; It's just not right.

Frankly it is one of the worst types of environments to find yourself in. It can be daunting. It can be draining. And above all, it takes a toll by lowering morale and is one of the worst feelings to experience. Office leaders do not understand the work that occurs and hence do not truly grasp the issues they contribute to.

Having been exposed to different environments, the level of politics and constant gossip between upper-level staff is remarkable at TD Securities (USA) LLC, especially considering the shear number of people Houston has hired in a move to grow in the market. The reality is that there are a few folks driving many of the antics, but you can expect to be demeaned openly, questioned at every turn, and find yourself always being on the look-out because trust is devoid.

The team leads are drivers of considerable gossip behind closed doors, and the Director level staff feel as though they have earned the positions to the point they act in vindictive manners towards those below them despite the junior staff doing the vast majority of the work for them. Staff in Houston want quick promotions and are willing to go behind others' backs to make it happen faster. The exposure to a variety of clients is great as is being a part of CIB, but the buck stops there. The level of nasty folks and rising toxicity is unfortunate, especially considering many of the staff members do recognize this and discuss the issues that cannot be voiced to those making key management decisions.",2,2,2,5,4,2,NA,NA

I work in retail. Regional management, in my region specifically, is very committed to rewarding, recognizing, and promoting hard-working employees. In the right store setting you will be valued and encouraged toward a career. Retail banking is a great stepping stone for someone looking to transition into the finance world without a degree, like myself, or other qualifications most companies look for. PTO is very generous, the best I've heard of at my level in any company.","The pressure is very high in retail banking to achieve sales. The quality of your production will really depend on the kind of atmosphere your store management team sets. if your direct leadership aren't good leaders - as in any industry - the store really suffers and isn't equipped to deal with performance pressure. While PTO is very generous, it can be hard to use it when you want in a store of 7 - 10 people on staff.

Every few years they even give an extra PTO day and bonuses are awarded based on performance yearly.","It’s easy to get comfortable here because the culture is great and the benefits are great, but the pay leaves a lot to be desired. It’s hard to get promoted because they constantly are doing reorganizations of various departments which causes more people to be posting for internal positions, it’s very competitive and unless you’re in with the right crowd, it’s unlikely to get the job. They claim to want to promote from within but I know many, including myself, who have been looked over for an external candidate or an internal candidate who was far less qualified. The biggest problem at TD is that management is completely disconnected and there’s no training, you’re thrown into a role with little to no support. I am disappointed to say the least as I wanted to continue my career with them for years to come, but after being promoted and not being fairly compensated as well as being bored out of my mind, I knew this wasn’t for me.",3,4,4,2,2,1,NA,NA

TD Bank is very unique in a sense that it isn’t your usual Financial Institution.

Once I get to work, I don’t always have to be physically in my desk exactly at 9am. If I am a parent dropping my kids off in school, as long as I do not have any scheduled meetings and it doesn’t interfere with my work or my team’s schedule, they have Flex-time! On days I have to stay home, I can work from home too. If you are planning for a family, birth or adoption, you get 4 months paid vacation.

One on one time with management to discuss personal development, career goals, and current positions. More so, allowing discussions on how to achieve those goals in the near future.

Fast-paced (most days)

Ability to make a direct impact on the lives of others

Allows for employees to make recommendations toward improvements internally to better support both the employee experience and the customer experience.","Need emotional strength: Non-customer facing brings about the boldness in others. Especially, on Tuesdays. There's no telling if an irate customer is about to curse someone out, or if a sweet elder is adjusting their ledger. Either could be this next call.

Rigid scheduling: 
Lack of intra-communication: Promotions (online, regional, call center ect.), system access (what some departments have access to, but don't know it), and the ability to find answers efficiently in the intraweb can be difficult and are sometimes lost in the cracks of the system. (But there IS support to be found elsewhere)

Continuous change in structure: People move into other positions frequently at TD which is both a pro and a con. Pro for obvious reasons (everyone enjoys a promotion). Con because one may sync with one system of personal management, but clash with the next--stunting performance overall.

Built for an Extrovert (Personal preference): As an introvert I gain and restore energy by being able to focus on complex problems and processing internally; using my creative abilities to push me forward and find new solutions to problems. As a call center rep, I speak for eight or nine hours a day. Sometimes, I feel like I'm more entertaining than finding solutions. I come home feeling exhausted. Some say that's a sign of having a successful workday, but not all. Where an extrovert gains their energy and propels through life exchanging energy externally with others, the call center position would work toward their strengths, and they could thoroughly enjoy themselves in this position. As an introvert I found this position to be exhilarating at first (learning to navigate the multiple systems, the physiology of each arm TD possess, gauging myself against the metrics).

Some branches are very slow where it is difficult to get sales.
You only have the Life Health Annuity License so you are very limited on the investment options.  
Managers will be moved a lot, sometimes leaving the branch without a manager or assistant for a period of time.
Vacation schedule has to be set up in the beginning of the year, which is difficult to have flexibility when setting up vacation times. 
Most branches are understaffed, you will have a lot of time rushing people in and out instead of being able to take time to explore investment needs with each customer.
Not a great career path for advancement if you want to stay in with investments.  They pretty much say that the only way to get into wealth is to get promoted to Assistant manager and then store manager.  A lot that some people do not want to do to get into TD Wealth.

Many employees, especially young and unmarried employees work two jobs. Very easy to hit a learning plateau and get burnt out if you don't want to build your career in retail.

Open 7 days a week with long shifts during the week to make up short weekend hours. No rhyme or reason to scheduling either, so unless you like to ask for a lot of PTO, work-life balance is terrible. Benefits are expensive for what they pay us and there's a minimum contribution to get a 401k match, which is difficult if not impossible for most retail employees, who make less than $45k a year. Extreme emphasis on customer service is not for everyone. There's a lot of pressure to make small talk with people, and you're expected to drop everything when there's customers in the store.

The same applies to raises and bonuses, no matter how favorable your performance evaluations were.
Diversity and inclusion is just not there yet, especially in Raleigh. I was such a fan of the “culture” and push for “diversity and inclusion” and I ate all of it up but the fact is, the diversity numbers are flat and retention of diverse employees is dismal, likely because they also only promote the same types of people. Not to mention everyone at the top pretty much looks the same. There’s sort of a mix in the middle and at the bottom but not really. Most who have any power or influence are w/m, with a w/f sprinkled in here and there. 
Employees basically go unsupported by ER because guess what, it’s not illegal to be backwards, ignorant, or a bigot, nor do they consider it a fireable offense. If you stick your neck out on the line just know that your career is over at the firm - they will not lay a safety net out for you and you will be labeled “problematic.”

There is a strong culture of internal mobility.

While I was not employed long enough to pursue promotion (2-3 yrs), the process seemed oddly subjective. From what I understood, unless one has the support of their direct line manager, they can never be promoted. So if a manager does not support one's personal growth, or if there are any clashes between  that manager and employee, that single manager can hinder an individual's opportunity to advance - even if the issue(s) are not performance related.

Titles are also important within this culture and will dictate how much income one can earn and how swiftly they can grow within the organization.

Furthermore, although the Raleigh site is the largest campus for CS, the company's senior management has no respect for the area and its people. Remember Raleigh employees, the only reason they hire you is because they're too cheap to hire in New York. As a result, the pay is absolutely lousy, completely uncompetitive compared to other banks and other companies in the Raleigh area.

Your every move is scrutinized and you're treated as if you are not trust worthy. No one listens to you if you're not praising them. Management focuses on the wrong issues. It appears to be an innovative, encouraging environment but it is outdated in management style. You have to conform to their antiquated way of doing things and you are not allowed to stand out. If you don't behave like the masses they treat you like a criminal. 

Keep your head down, comply, get your experience and leave. Don't believe them when they say they want your input or suggestions. It is a trap. Just smile and agree. Even if the process is broken. They don't want your input because they have to much pride to admit processes are inefficient.  Don't try to be an individual.  Nothing makes since and it won't just do as your told.

Schedule flexibility (very limited).
Internal training (very limited).
Business casual dress code (jeans allowed).
Opportunity for new hires to gain broad professional experience.","Managers discourage employee engagement in internal training opportunities but encourage participation in goofy activities to make their team look active in company community. 

It is a very punitive environment; team has been told that if anyone misses reporting their status on time, forgets to close a request for change (RFC) on time, etc., even just one time, their rating is automatically reduced to a B. Getting a B status would prevent the team members from qualifying for internal mobility and could impact their salary and bonus, if there is one. 

IT employees have to listen to bastardized English all day because very few IT workers speak fluent English, and workers are expected to understand the message that is relayed even if the wrong message is mistakenly delivered. Employees receive conflicting messages regarding the assignment expectations and are expected to meet the different expectations at the last minute.

Managers from India, and even workers from India, seem to aggressively push for work to be sent off-shore or to bring more off-shore employees to the US. They look for excuses to send the work off-shore. They try to facilitate sending work off-shore too, but do not assist the U.S. workers in the same way.

It is definitely a foreign work environment, not an American work environment. It is like entering India when you arrive on the IT floors. 

The schedule flexibility is minimal and managers ding you if you exceed their undocumented and unspoken quota, even if they approve it (late arrival due to doctor appointment or work from home). 

There is a significant communication problem in IT due to the language and cultural barriers.

The application-level onboarding is terrible. 

The communication gap and cultural gap create much unnecessary frustration for employees, not to mention the loss of information critical to the success of projects, and draining the morale.

Foreigners promote foreigners like in a good old boys type of network, excluding U.S. citizens. 
They promote the foreigners at the expense of the U.S. citizens. When work is going well for a U.S citizen, they will yank it from them and send it off-shore. When the foreign manager is in a jam due to being behind on something way overdue, they will assign it to a U.S. citizen. They do very little to help the U.S. citizen learn applications even when other workers are familiar with it, but expect the U.S. citizen to learn and document the applications to make it ""easy"" to bring the off-shore workers up to speed, to send the work off-shore when there are unemployed U.S. citizens who could do the work right here.",1,3,1,1,1,1,NA,NA

101,empReview_6826331, Credit Suisse,Investment Banking - Equity Capital Markets Associate,Current Employee - Equity Capital Markets Associate,I have been working at Credit Suisse full-time for more than 5 years,"Credit Suisse has a diverse work force, and a management team that is committed to an accepting culture. This attitude is reflected in the majority of employees, which makes it a pleasant place to work. Work life balance is not necessarily possible in Investment Banking, but Credit Suisse seems to be more sensitive to it than other firms. Junior people are not expected to work Friday nights or Saturdays, which is a dramatic shift from what it was like 5-10 years ago. Compensation is competitive, and the work experience is very good because the firm works on many of the more high profile transactions. Internal mobility is another focus for the firm, which creates many opportunities for people that want to move around and try new things","Although it's not as bad as some other banks, working in investment banking is just as grueling at Credit Suisse for the most part. Also, since it's a large company, junior people don't have as many opportunities to ""see the whole picture"" as resources as often assigned to specific roles and are not able to work on certain aspects of a transaction",4,2,4,4,5,3,NA,NA
101,empReview_6719193, Credit Suisse,Solid Employer - Recommended for Grads,Current Employee - Automation Engineer,I have been working at Credit Suisse full-time for more than 3 years,"I joined the IT analyst program which was definitely a great career starter and provided great exposure to the company and the different businesses. The benefits are very solid and high performers have plenty of ways to get recognized with various initiatives and a cash bonus from your manager. 

Internal mobility is widely advertised and strongly encouraged, it's a nice win-win for everyone and I made a move one year in and as a result have no regrets. I now have a new network of colleagues and get to see things from a different perspective. International mobility is also encouraged and supported.

There are a lot of internal networks and communities that a lot of employees partake in and there seems to be something for everyone, with enough support and a sponsor you can even create your own! 

Joining from college I was very impressed by the general level of professionalism and drive a lot of people have here. Now, I'm not one to like politics and tend to stay away from political matters. Like most large financial institutions there is going to be a fair amount of it in play the higher up the food-chain you go and Credit Suisse is no different. I will say it certainly pays to have good reputation with as many people as possible. 

Every year CS hosts an event recognizing individuals and groups who have contributed heavy to philanthropic efforts and every year I see employees from all ranks and departments devoting their own time to charities, outside initiatives, non-profit boards and local community projects which is really inspiring and lends an interesting contrast to the work-work-work mentality. CS gives all FTEs one full day off a year to participate in a philanthropic event or project.

Depending on your manager you may be given some leeway to have flexible work hours and work from home. I take full advantage of this and spend maybe 30% in the office. It helps break the daily routine and saves time, commute costs and energy.

All my managers have been very supportive of me and have been willing to defend my work and actions in front of others. They have all encouraged me to drive my own career and always seek new opportunities. They've also not tried to micro-manage me and put of a lot of trust and responsibility on me. They always made time for me if there was something urgent that needed addressing and in my opinion have been honest, no-BS type of people who I look up to.","Depending on your role you might experience a fair amount of red tape which will prolong tasks like requesting resources (servers, applications, access) and tools. IT procurement is probably one of the most painful due to the number of justifications and approvals required.

Tight budgets and heavy regulations will likely have an effect on your productivity one way or another. The plus side to this is that, compared to smaller companies, accountability, ownership and responsibility is more heavily weighted here but I've been in situations where there has been finger pointing or where people didn't take responsibility for a project or consequence. 

Working in IT I'm exposed to what seems to be a never-ending spree of change freezes which, unless you request an exception, causes all production impacting changes to be postponed until after the freeze, major/minor releases, changes to a production server, even the smallest of changes.

Along with the above CS seems to have a process for everything (if you can find out what it is). Having a relatively junior position I use my naive-ness to point out processes that are much too burdensome for small requests but a lot of time there's a lot of push-back to change the process that has been around for a long time (people also like hiding behind processes to evade extra work or to play the evasion/hot-potato game). It sometimes feels like I'm taking to a brick wall in these situations and the only way is to escalate this up but sometimes it's just not worth bothering.

Being a global organization means that certain platforms and applications are only supported out of one region and sometimes you'll loose a good chunk of time due to time-zone delays (you're always asleep when they're awake and vice versa). Having the support team be in more than a single region could help but unfortunately, like in the case of Switzerland, certain operations cannot be outsourced due to regulatory or legal reasons.",4,4,4,4,4,4,NA,NA

113,empReview_5111539, Credit Suisse,Stay away from IT in the AMRS region at least in the equity derivatives space.,Former Employee - Derivatives IT,I worked at Credit Suisse full-time for more than a year,"Location and having the name of a ""big"" bank on your resume.","1) I was hired after the crash in 2008 after mass layoffs at another firm.  They gave me a lowball offer that I unfortunately had to take - not a great way to start building trust.

2) All the decisions for this company are made in other regions.  Equity derivatives IT was a bare-bones operation in AMRS.  The management decisions were made in London and nearly ALL of the development and tech talent was in Singapore.  Every ounce of knowledge I needed to learn was offshore and specifically in Singapore.  I consider myself a fairly motivated person driven to succeed but you can't build a good initial knowledge base of the systems you need to work on if the only folks you have to talk to are in the complete opposite time zone and too busy to teach you which leads me to my next point.

3) The folks in Singapore(mostly from India) were worked like they were at a Foxconn factory and we in AMRS were expected to compete with that.  This essentially means no upward mobility if you want any kind of a life.

4) The lower level managers are pretty weak and transparent in their efforts to pull results out of people and teams.  I wouldn't consider any of them good leaders or even good mentors.  Managers are afraid of upper management and just whip folks below them.  Part of this is company culture but years later being in that position myself I either mentor and look after my folks properly or it's time to leave.

5) Insane amount of bureaucracy but this is typical of a Swiss bank - you wouldn't see this at other investment banks at that time.

6) Insanely cheap; penny wise and dollar foolish - management couldn't wait to get their hands on the next up and coming tech-region where folks were even more desperately looking for work.  This year Singapore, next year close down that hub and head over to Malaysia or somewhere else all the while killing continuity in your development projects and team growth.  It's not like they were paying the folks in Singapore anything good either compared to a salary in the EMEA or AMRS region.  Beyond that, offshoring everything and providing everyone an awful service just to save a buck just gets annoying to all but upper-management.  You're constantly trying to sync up with folks in other regions and more time is spend doing that than actually getting anything done.

Years later I have learned that offshoring can be utilized but there are limits.  Follow-the-sun models and regional dependencies look great on paper but in reality they are much tougher to execute properly for the folks actually doing it.  You'll wind up with a high turnover rate.

7) No free coffee - this seems small and petty but it raises an important point.  If a company is too cheap to offer free coffee at the bare minimum you do NOT want to work for them.  This is the cheapest and simplest daily ""thank-you"" lifestyle accommodation a company can make for their employees.

I'm sure there are folks who are very happy in this company but they are at least at the director level where they can stay above the churning of the masses.  Don't be dazzled by big banks for IT; you will not get ahead there.

This is not hyperbole,"This review will focus on their FCM business in Chicago as this is the area I worked in, however the comments in general are relevant to all areas of the organization mainly because the issues at this company are widespread and encompass all business lines.

The morale in the company is at an all time low. It’s truly like a ticking time bomb. You never know when the next round of layoffs will be, but rest assured there will be more.  I am sure the vast majority of employees are searching for job.  

Management is basically inept and at the ready to layoff employees as soon as the slightest dip in earnings occurs.  In other words they'll layoff people purely to make quarterly numbers.  Several months later the positions for those that were let go will be reposted, but at salaries that were well below what they being paid.  It's sad but true.

Compensation is a minimum of 20% below market, that's if you're lucky, but more like 30%.  This is something they openly admit to, and as you can imagine results in them being unable to recruit any real talent.

There is NO growth in Chicago.  Instead the business has been in steady decline for at least the last five if not ten years. You don't have layoffs for years on end if your business is succeeding!

The pecking order is Paris, New York, and Chicago being a very distant third.  If you work in Chicago you’ll more than likely report up to someone in New York.  The problem here is that most management in New York have had careers that started and reputable firms but have since followed a downward spiral to working for Societe Generale.  Since most are incompetent and only concerned with their own continued employment they make hasty decisions just to make numbers, which results in loss of jobs.  You'll read this in almost every review.

9,empReview_20243608, Société Générale,Chaotic mess with a surreal backdrop,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,I have been working at Société Générale full-time for more than a year,"Few and far between, frankly, I can't think of any.","To put it bluntly SG is a disaster! Headcount in Chicago in 2012 was around 550, today it’s around 200.  I’m not a math whiz but that’s roughly 64% reduction in force over 4 years.  Most of the jobs were lost to either India or Montreal as SG views a developer in India as fungible with an American developer with a decade of industry experience.  Needless to say their offshoring and nearshoring tactics have not had the best results for the company.  Back in November of 2016 they laid off the entire development staff for a critical back office component in their architecture.  Volume increased the software broke and there was no one to fix it.  If you want to read an article regarding this google “SocGen Computer Glitch Said to Ripple Through Bond Derivatives”.  SG may have saved $1M in headcount but the resulting outage cost them in excess of $50M.  The continued layoffs over the years resulted in over three empty floors in their previous offices at 550 W. Jackson, which prompted the firm to look for new space.  They ended up moving to 440 S. LaSalle, a building that is 60% empty, where they could pay pennies on the dollar compared to where they were before.  Don’t be fooled by the thin veneer of their new shiny offices as below surface lurks nothing but a company on the verge of imploding.  Glassdoor did a great article on the types of companies to avoid titled “7 Types of Companies You Should Never Work For” and SG fits almost every one of these.  I bring this up now as one type they mention in the article “The Curb Appealer” just popped into my head when speaking about their new offices.  

When it comes to talent there isn’t any left.  The brain drain has already run its course, leaving the firm with absolutely zero talent in their Chicago office.  What they’re left with are C players who think they’re A players (umm…, A players work for Goldman) and cult-like managers and their idiot followers.  When it comes to incompetent management, you’d be hard pressed to find a bigger group of lackeys.  I’ve never worked anywhere where the vast majority of people including management were uneducated.  It’s fair to say 80-85% of their employees in Chicago lack a college degree and most if not all are just hanging on hoping they aren’t let go in the next round of layoffs.  

The complete and total disaster SG’s Chicago office has become is not entirely their fault though.  The trading industry as a whole is in the worst shape it’s ever been in.  It is not just FCMs that are feeling the pressure but also exchanges like CME and ICE that have been struggling as well. In the vendor space 99% of the technology being sold is at least a quarter of a century old.  SG’s core vendor on the front office trading side is Fidessa, which was written in the early 90s. In the proprietary trading space, most firms are on life support especially the high frequency players most of whom will exit the business in the coming years.  If you’d like to learn more about the current state of the industry just google “Dwindling numbers in the financial industry” one of the first results is an article that paints a clear picture as to just how grim things really are.

I totally expect this review to receive a tone-deaf response from Paris touting what a great place SG is to work for but the harsh reality is my review paints a clear picture of their Chicago office. My advice to anyone looking to take a job with SG is to think twice if not three times before accepting an offer.  You’ll be doing yourself a huge disservice by working here.",1,3,1,1,1,1,NA,NA

They will micromanage everything at a ridiculous scale. Do you need a software on your computer? Call the help desk. The help desk might not install the software you need for work.

If you need to do development on a Linux server, they will give you hard time getting you access or right permissions.

No regard for sprints; user stories are added, removed, spilled-over in active sprints at free will. Instead of scrum masters, they have 'agile masters' who hardly have any knowledge about scrum practices, leave alone having proper CSM certification.
2) Business analysts are used mostly as testers. I am a business analyst and I spend 90% of my time testing. If you want to gain more functional knowledge and move towards product management, DO NOT COME HERE!!!!
3) Some French counterparts can be very arrogant and treat Indians as slaves. I had the misfortune of working with a particularly nasty client whose 'professional behavior' ranged from throwing temper tantrums in scrum meetings to disconnecting calls on your face and ignoring Skype pings on purpose. However, some French clients are good and well mannered.

I was working in the Cash Support Department. It is the worst project i have ever seen. Below are the things that was alarming:

1. Societe Generale is a bank, so it should ideally be having compliance issue. But in that project, not everyone had their own access to the machines. They used to share the credential and work. Even after reporting this to management, they did not take any action.

2. They still used very old ways of doing things. Like for deployment there was no proper pipeline. People manually used to do that.. Way behind the current trends.

3. Worst thing was the culture. People never used to share the knowledge with any of the new team mates. 

4. They were entirely dependent on the Paris team for any new projects. The Management of Bangalore failed to bring any good quality work from them. So, all good quality works were done by them and all crappy work were delegated to Bangalore team.

5. Management was just mere puppet.

French don't understand what you say, you don't understand what they say. Whatever little English you might know before coming to this company will be forgotten. Even the official mails won't be properly phrased. 

The biggest con of all: inequality. So I come from a good college, so I was directly hired as a senior software engineer. But the same work and designation are also given to many developers with 10+ years of experience. This is one reason why teammates try to screw themselves. Designation matters. No one will listen to a good idea if it comes from a developer. People will implement the faulty design the lead proposes. Remember about working smart.

Pros:
Work life balance - depends on the team.
Pay structure- 50% of your pay is basic as such employer contributes good share towards your pf.
European onsite counterparts are really cool to work with !","Management is totally clueless where they are heading to.
Innumerable outdated tools/applications.
If you are good at appeasing ur higher ups u;ll climb up the ladder.
Fake innovation / automation projects, they are just adding up more nonsense tools in the name of innovation /automation.
Career growth is very slow and too many levels/sub-levels in the hierarchy this makes it even more challenging to grow up.
Learning curve is really bad as Paris keeps all the creamy works and offshores only unwanted things to India. Dont' ever think of getting into this org if you want good learning curve.
Branching out of this company is really difficult as your skills sets would be outdated by working in legacy environment and  on non-core stuff.
Beware of fake jd's- they sell the jd's very well at the time of hiring,  when you pitch into to the work u'll see a whole world of difference between what was stated in jd and the actual work.
No open door policy.
Management in Bangalore is just focused on pleasing their onsite partners.
Mediocre faclities to employees, hardware resources  provided is of very bad quality, office interiors is outdated,   there is no Doctor on site, cafeteria is just average, transport is pathetic.

Corporate culture is constantly developing, and from year to year it may almost seem as if you're working in a different company, thanks to significant emphasis on innovation in all sectors of the bank.

All employees receive a private health insurance for them and their children, and subsidized private health insurance for their spouses. Also, employees receive benefits in using banking products.

Paris management may intend to change things for good.","The single most irritating thing is the presence of lots and lots of managers at unit head level in India, doing absolutely nothing good !! This is almost unbelievable. One has to see them in front of the French to really believe what weight on earth they are. Yes I mean sycophancy. French are not bothered either because at any time they are lot more cheaper and somehow 'help' running the company in India.

If someone want to see live example of the (in)famous Peter's principle, Societe Generale Global Solutions Centre, Bangalore is the place to see. God only knows what the managers here are good for. They don't provide any functional or technical leadership, simply because they don't tackle challenges in their day to day work. They have long before stopped building any kind of competency. The only skill left is survival, and it is not that much difficult in a outsourcing based business model or so called 'cost centre'. Do nothing and look busy ! this is guiding principle. Organize futile sessions but don't do anything meaningful. Sessions are organized frequently, sometime by external 'experts', with some childish powerpoint and lot of gibberish.

Senior managers pretend as if they are getting the work done by the real work horses, which anyway will be done even without them. The pseudo hyper activism of senior folks is just due to this, lack of real work. So they end of up doing all kind of meaningless stuff, whatever they do their heart is not there, only objective of these people is self promotion.

The mangers do lot of pretense and useless stuff wasting their and others' time. Ninety percent of meetings are waste and still they sit in those meetings as if they are discussing the most important matters !
In their desperation to look smart than others the managers do more meaningless things. They are non technical and as far as management is concerned, there is not much to manage as such, they have lots of cheap labor to employ. So a deceptive seriousness and attentiveness in futile meetings keep them busy !!!
Yes it is so hollow in Societe Generale, Bangalore.

The technology is generally old if not very old. Most of the work is around the so called production support.
The company don't provide much to a techie, the managers rule here. There is very less fresh work and people are not aware of latest things in world of technology. They repeat jargon day and night that is another matter.",2,3,3,2,3,1,NA,NA

I worked for the company in bangalore and i resigned from the company as the company management ( not only project manager,I'm talking about the very top management here )was indifferent to employees concerns on escalations related to violation of company's policies and values by our immediate management and putting the business interests ahead of doing business in a right way. Still i found some positives

1) As per the policy, your manager cannot close the appraisal unless and until you agree and close it in system.

2) The company' has creche for toddlers ( for employees kids) and a gym.

3) The company, being a investment bank, you can expect a decent hike every year.

4) The company based on your entitlement pays a less-interest loan of some amount( I got 1 lakh rupess as loan).

5) Not sure, but I've heard people saying that work-life balance was good in the company.

6 )Importantly the company pays you on time.","1) The top management will always side with your manager if you've differences with your manager on any count( sexual harassment, appraisal was closed due to pressure from manager, long working hours , staying back in night, etc) as they tend to put business interests first.

2) Location : The company is located in ITPL and most of the employees used to spend everyday 2 or more hours everyday on travel only.

3) There will be a 10% variable pay on your salary, which they will pay only at the end of the financial year.

4) Once you join a department, ex: Compliance, it will be literally very hard to switch between departments( even though as per policy you can switch after a year or so) as they won't allow you citing various reasons especially if you're a performer or they've committed your time to the client. Importantly you don't know which department you're going to join till you join the company :). They won't tell you in the interview.

5) Critically, the company don't have anything like a Resource management system (like RMG in TCS) which will be of great use to know which projects are there in the company , what are the opportunities and what is the openings available currently.

6) The Business analysts used to slog it out and were under tremendous pressure.

So the critical thing is ask the HR during interview itself on which department they're going to place you and get as many details you can get about the project. Have a word with your project manager first before joining the company.

 I wish you all the best.

Glassdoor forces to choose one star atleast otherwise I would have chosen thousand negative stars. It does not deserve any stars","1. Literally illiterate people sit on your head as managers and start screwing you even when they know that they can not even spell ""Technical"" on their own.

2. Too much of insecurity among the so called ""Senior Technical Leads"" as they themselves do not know much and when you ask something from them, they will either try to humiliate you or will avoid telling because they know that their bluff will be caught. Simply unaware of any concepts either technically or domain related. They never believe in sharing any sort of information.

3. Managers turn a blind eye to something wrong their so called ""Leads"" are doing because they are hand in gloves with Leads.

4. Once you try to escalate something, management tries to harass you.

5. You are only expected to nod your head in yes to every crap that comes out of management's mouth.

6. Managers are mere monitors here who would really stoop down to the level of monitoring your loo timings as well. They expect you to be there when they want and leave when they want.

7. For timings, even if you would argue that my work is complete and i have never delayed any delivery, they would say that still you sit in your place and I have been told by a senior manager that He would like to see me on desk only, even if i am browsing e-commerce websites, its okay

8. All Junk (whom they call their ""Technical and Senior technical Leads"") simply keep on browsing e-commerce websites, some 1000 things you don't know about kind of articles and are good for nothing.

9. You will be evaluated by your managers and so called Leads for every single tiny detail but your opinion or feedback is never asked and even if you are bold enough to escalate to higher management, Managers and Leads will make sure to make your life a living hell. Never Ever your feedback will be asked.

10. All the people here try an judge others while it would be nicer for them to have a look at themselves first.

11. All you will be asked is to work on some ancient legacy projects. Worse than worst service based company. A nightmare for techies.

* The environment is not only unsupportive and non-collaborative, but does really get unprofessional, with rude and insulting behaviour from manager and 'senior' colleagues , if they just decide they don't like you. Some people would even say toxic environment. Very moody and child-like behaviour from some seniour members, they will exclude you in team discussions and/or out-of-office networking.

* Good management will often involve communicating clearly firm's objectives , understanding employees longer-term aspirations and try to marry them. Not at this bank. In my 1 year's stint at SGCIB, my manager didn’t have a meaningful conversation about career progression, although it was part of formal appraisal process.

* I won't even get into the regional politics and Paristhrowing it's weight around -- as this is well known in the industry and to a degree expected. What;s interesting is they use word 'global' or 'multinational' quite a lot.

* Very loud French environment. I've heard some obscene use of language by seniors

* Cronyism at it's height, there is no transparency. Agreement on what, when, how things are to be done is not seek within team -- it is told. The actual words of one of managers just on the 2nd week of my starting a new role : 'this is not a democracy' surprised me a little.

Slow to implement strategies, slow to recognise talent and slow grow in the right areas.",1,1,NA,1.5,1,1,NA,NA

155,empReview_593217, Société Générale,It is full of politics. Very bad place for MBAs. Good for only B.Coms.,Process Executive,I have been working at Société Générale ,It provides good package compared to its peers for similar jobs. HR policies are very good. Learning opportunities are good,"It is not a place for MBAs or highly qualified. In Bangalore, It is not doing anything in Investment Banking. It is back-end process (BPO) here. Simple B.Com is enough for the work getting done here. Even management here do not care for MBAs/ICWAs/CAs. They get the same designation and salary as B.COMs.

The work culture is very pathetic here. It is fill of petty politics here. It is not fun. Even seating arrangements shows managements recognition or lack of it for the employees. There is no cubicle here. Anybody can look at anybody's computers. There is no privacy at all.

They treat employees like cattle. They don't provide access to Internet for BPO employees. It is too hell to work there.

Promotion depends on the years of experience and seniority, no matter how good you are at work.",1,2,NA,2,3,1,NA,NA

The academic level of the employees is quite high (In front office, mostly graduates from Polytechnique et Centrale). This company deliver very complex financial products, has an efficient IT infrastructure and in spite (or because ) of ""l'affaire Kerviel"" the security systems are quite developed.","If you are hired as an intern or VIE at SocGen, it might be an interesting experience, but your chances of receiving a permanent offer at the end of your temporary contract are quite low. When I did my internship, in early 2009, maybe 20 percent of the interns were hired, but that was during the crisis. Also, it seems VIE are hired quite often in Front office jobs, a bit less when they work in IT or middle office.",3,3,NA,1,2.5,3,NA,NA

2. Completely disengaged from employees. Would say there is no HR dept as such. 
3. Sr.PM are useless. Many people are just promoted ........ and they are like a frog in well.
4.  you will find many AVP's and VP's .....which is the most  Funniest part of this company
5. AVP and VP are very Arrogant.
6. HR Policies change as per VP's Advice
7. NOT sure Where and what our MR.CEO is doing.................... WAKE UP!!!!! CEO
8. One advice to new joiner - Think 10times before you join SGCIB

1) Good compensation and Benefits.
2) Opportunity to gain on the domain knowledge thereby enhancing the value on the resume for people willing to work in the financial industry.
3) Good opportunity to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
4) Opportunity to work with senior folks in France(This is a big take away as in India we often don't get to work with many senior folks)","Well for all the advantages listed, SG India comes with its own bag(big one) of disadvantages.
1) Be sure about the kind of work you are getting in to. Majority of the work available in India are long term maintenance projects and there are very few development projects.
2)  Very limited exposure to latest technological trends as banking industry in general tends to go with the tested frameworks and technologies rather than newbies in the market.
3) Incompetent middle level managers incapable any conflict resolution.
4) Most of the decisions are done by Paris teams, and India appears just to be a cost centre rather than a strategic development centre.
5) Poor emphasis on processes.
6) Rigid team structures, timings and overall a very rigid idea about how to get work done.
7) Very lethargic induction program.",2,3.5,NA,2,4,1,NA,NA

Very well balanced between personal life and work . 5 years is a max in this bank","Situation getting worse since 2008. 
Top Management completely short-minded, trying to get employees believing everything's fine.
A mexican army of employees, most of which are powerpoint pros.
Too much people to work on a single simple case, that makes the 1000 emails threshold a minimum
SG becoming a low-tier bank while few years ago the name was respected in the industry.
