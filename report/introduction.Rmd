# Introduction
As part of a [Text Mining](https://hecnet.unil.ch/hec/syllabus/descriptif/2441) course taught at HEC Lausanne by Professor [Marc-Olivier Boldi](https://hecnet.unil.ch/hec/recherche/fiche?pnom=mboldi&dyn_lang=en), we are going to carry out the following project : Predicting company ratings through Glassdoor Reviews. </p>

Glassdoor is a website where current and former company employees anonymously evaluate their salary, work environment and the company. Being the reference for obtaining information that is not made public by companies, the website has a large audience which is mainly due to the fact that the current and former employees are very active on the platform and therefore counts a lot of reviews on different companies. </p>

The aim of our project is to predict company rating of five banks ( **JP Morgan **,  **Deutsche Bank **,  **TD **,  **HSBC Holdings ** and  **UBS **) based on reviews from the [Glassdoor](http://glassdoor.com/)'s website. We want to see if there are differences and similarities between the five banks in order to determine if some factors are more responsible of the success of one of the company. Are there some patterns that human resources will be able to use to increase competitiveness? Are there specific characteristics that are recurrent in the industry ? In addition, knowing how Glassdoor reviews work can give us insights into the job market, but above all, information about the corporate culture, which is very important to us since we are currently looking for an internship and would like to join a good company. </p>

In order to achieve our objective, we will apply different techniques to extract valuable information from the texts. After performing an *exploratory analysis*, we will perform a *semantic analysis*. Then we will fit a topic model, using the Latent  *Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)* method. Finally, we will use machine learning methods by doing regression tasks  to predict which model is the best at predicting the rating. </p>
