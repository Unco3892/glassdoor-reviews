# Abstract
In the following report, we employ Text Mining methods to predict company ratings through Glassdoor Reviews. </p>

First, we treat positive and negative parts of each review separately, then as part of our pre-treatment we apply different techniques, such as removal of stopwords and lemmatization and performed an exploratory analysis. </p>

In second time, we observe through the application of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method that it is difficult to distinguish which tokens are more specific to each topic that no topic is specific to any company.</p>

Finally, we conclude our work with supervised learning methods and perform a grid search in order to find the best model and hyperparameters to predict the rating. After comparison, we conclude that the best model is the one with the lowest RMSE, which constist of a random forest using LSA on the TF-IDF with 30 topics for the positive part of the reviews and 20 for the negative part of the reviews.
